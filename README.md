### Description

This is a game written in Visual Basic. Many of you have probably seen it here already as I had it posted here in the past. This has a few bug fixes, updates, etc. I look forward to any comments, suggestions, and constructive critisism you might have regarding it. For those wondering what it is, it's a game using BitBlt, which has enemy ai, levels, pickups, and it's plenty of fun :)
